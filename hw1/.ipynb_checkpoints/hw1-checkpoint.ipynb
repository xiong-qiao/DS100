The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health and we have made these data available to you via the DS 100 repository. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored. We will walk through the various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this.

    "What we see when we opened the file above is good news! It looks like this file is indeed a csv file. Let's check the other three files. This time, rather than opening up the files manually, let's use Python to print out the first 5 lines of each. The `ds100_utils` library has a method called `head` that will allow you to retrieve the first N lines of a file as a list. For example `ds100_utils.head('data/legend.csv', 5)` will return the first 5 lines of \"data/legend.csv\". Try using this function to print out the first 5 lines of all four files that we just extracted from the zipfile."

    "First, make a dataframe called `scores_pairs_by_business` indexed by `business_id` (containing only businesses with exactly 2 inspections in 2016).  This dataframe contains the field `score_pair` consisting of the score pairs ordered chronologically  `[first_score, second_score]`. \n",
